# Hello-World
My name is Brian Halbach, I used to be an active programmer, but after I finished my CS minor in College I have to worked on many projects. I am creating this GitHub account to share any of my new projects with the world instead of keeping them locked up on my local machine. I don't plan on creating anything really great or useful just a lot of projects for myself to tinker with.
